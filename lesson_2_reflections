  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creats hidden dir (.git) ,and starts to be visible to git commands. 




  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?

	It is intermiddle area between working dir and repository , you can add files 
	in it one by one. When we are ready to commit files from staging area to repo 
	it bundles files in one commit. 


  How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?


	Commiting per file . 


  

  What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
   How would branches help?


	When we want to try adding some new feature to our code but dont want to risk a bug in 		master branch , or main part of code. So we have that luxury to experiment.


  How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Its easy to see what commit is last mutural for master and new branch , and which 		commits arent included to new branch.
